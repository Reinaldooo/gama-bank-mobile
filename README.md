  ## Gama Bank Project


Thinking about reaching a wider audience when accessing an application, in addition to the Gama-Bank front end web project, we were able to experience the development of the mobile application.

Each part of the application was designed, tested and revised, to offer the end user an extremely satisfactory experience in accessing and using the resources offered by Gama-Bank.

The application's loyalty in relation to the client's visual identity was also thought of in its details, in order to make the client's communication with its target audience ever closer, limited by the credibility and trust attributed to this organization.

Technically the application was developed in order to contribute to any future needs for scalability of the application, so that it can accompany the growth of the brand with its consumer market.

## Frontend built with 

  - [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/)  - React Native combines the best parts of native development with React, a best-in-class JavaScript library for building user interfaces
   - [Expo](https://docs.expo.io/) - Expo is a framework and a platform for universal React applications
  - [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) - A Predictable State Container for JS Apps
  - [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - TypeScript is an open-source language which builds on JavaScript
  - [Styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) - Visual primitives for the component age
  - [Unform](https://unform.dev/) - Unform is a performance-focused API for creating powerful forms experiences for both React and React Native
  - [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/) - React Testing Library builds on top of DOM Testing Library by adding APIs for working with React components
  - [Yup](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - Yup is a simple object schema validator I came across recently. It is inspired by Joi, but smaller than that, so it is probably a better fit to the client side
